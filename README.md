# SQL_Portfolio

## SQL P1
In this project, I downloaded data from [This Link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) until March 2023 to analyze global and Malaysia's COVID-19 deaths using SQL. 

## SQL P2(Data Cleaning)
I practiced data cleaning skills using data from [This link](https://github.com/khawzk/SQL_Portfolio/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)

## Tableau Dashboard to show the findings in P1

I created a Tableau dashboard to visualize the findings from P1. You can view the dashboard on [Link to Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/khaw2413/viz/COVIDAnalysis_16789357362430/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
